PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive.
## üåê Stacking Fault
In comparison with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and few more.

The design and simplicity of PyCaret are inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more technical expertise. PyCaret was inspired by the caret library in R programming language.

## üåê Classification
PyCaret is tested and supported on 64-bit systems with:
- Python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11
- Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- Windows 7 or later


PyCaret's default installation will not install all the optional dependencies automatically. Depending on the use case, you may be interested in one or more extras:
