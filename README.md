# Image Detection
## üåê Grain Size
In this section, you will find OpenCV-based image processing methods used to analyze grain sizes detected in Poly-Si thin film solar cells. OpenCV is an open-source library used for computer vision and image processing.

## üåê Stacking Fault
This section presents methods used with OpenCV to detect defects in images. Evaluating stacking faults with OpenCV enables assessment of solar cell quality.

# Machine Learning

## üåê Classification
This section provides insights into creating and evaluating classification models using PyCaret. PyCaret has been tested on 64-bit systems and is supported on the following systems:
- Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Ubuntu 16.04 or above
- Windows 7 or above

PyCaret's default installation does not automatically install all optional dependencies. Depending on your use case, you may need to handle one or more additional dependencies.
